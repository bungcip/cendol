## 2024-07-25 - Expensive Cloning in MIR
**Learning:** The MIR's `Place` and `Operand` enums use `Box<T>` for recursive data structures. Every time these are cloned, it triggers a deep copy and a new heap allocation, which is a significant performance anti-pattern in a compiler's intermediate representation.
**Action:** Replace `Box<T>` with `std::rc::Rc<T>`. This will change cloning from an expensive deep-copy operation to a cheap reference-counting operation. Given that the MIR is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), there's no risk of reference cycles, making `Rc` a safe and effective optimization.
