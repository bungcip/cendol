Learning: C11 `_Generic` constraints (6.5.1.1) require both that the controlling expression matches at most one association AND that no two associations specify compatible types. Compatibility checking for `_Generic` must strip qualifiers from both the associations and the decayed controlling expression.
Action: Always verify that constraints involving type compatibility (like `_Generic` or `typedef` redefinition) correctly handle qualifiers and decay according to the specific rules of that language feature.
